**1. Abstract:**

In late December 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China's health officials observed an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown origin, which is Coronavirus disease 2019, officially known as COVID-19 (Ciotti, et al., 2020). This COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on our daily lives. Many of us are confronted with difficulties that can be stressful and overwhelming. Public health measures like social distancing are necessary to stop COVID-19 from spreading as the environment is not as safe and secure as before, which in turn makes us feel isolated and lonely, as well as increases stress and anxiety. As social distancing is in place, many businesses, schools, etc., are facing a slew of new obstacles being closed and looking to reopen. To reopen any IT company/business/school many safety measures and protocols need to be in place so that students, employees, owners will not hesitate to go to their workplace and overcome the isolation they are facing right now.

With the COVID-19 in place, I being a student think twice and hesitate to go to the university or any workplace to access the library, attend lectures, or work with my peers or colleagues as a team because of this pandemic as I am unaware whether the workplace is safe and secure free from COVID, and raises a question what if my peers or colleagues are suffering from this unknowingly. This always creates a kind of disturbance in me, resulting in mental stress. Along with this, with everything gone online, I get a feeling of isolation that is causing issues with my mental health. Many people might be facing similar issues. So, considering all these, the purpose of this paper is to address the problem of isolation and make the situation like before it used to be by providing them with a COVID free environment so that they can get exposed to their workplace and work with their peers or colleagues of their choice without any second thought, which helps in preventing a feeling of isolation, raising their confidence levels improving their mental health. In this IT project, I want to focus on developing an application that will provide people with a secure environment to work as a team of their choice confidently without thinking about the current pandemic and make them relieved from their mental stress by not worrying about being isolated from everyone or the work environment.

**Key Words:** Pandemic, COVID-19, isolation, mental health, social distancing

**2. Introduction:**

COVID-19 is prevalent in the world right now. Everything, everyone is related to COVID-19 somehow, either directly or indirectly. It started in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The initial outbreak of this virus was reported in Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and 66% of the employees in the market were affected. Some researchers admitted that bats may be the culprits of this virus but there was no solid evidence to show how the virus has originated, and the research is still going on.  This virus can transmit primarily from person to person either through respiratory droplets or by contact transmission (Wu, et al., 2020). Another way the virus can spread through is air, which was acknowledged by CDC, but this is as well undergoing some research. The symptoms of this virus vary from person to person. Some people may have symptoms immediately, while some may have in 14 days or after 14 days.  

The virus spread was rapid and hit across 150 nations, with the United States recording a great number of cases, making everyone work remotely from their home by not contacting anyone personally (face to face). Many of the universities as well, followed the same protocol and shut down universities completely after the 2020 spring break. Although there was a complete lockdown, starting from March 2020 to August 2020, 18,738,58 laboratory-confirmed cases got recorded as of the 2nd week of April 2020 (Fong, et al., 2020). Working remotely and the shutdown of the universities suddenly developed a feeling of being isolated in individuals affecting their mental health. According to a journal by Cambridge University Press Public Health Emergency Collection, loneliness has several adverse impacts on mental health like reduced sleep efficiency, increased depressive Symptomatology, and suicidal symptoms.

Some of the universities are conducting at least one in-person lecturing to students starting from August 2020. But the IT companies are still following the same and encouraging their employees to work remotely. This is like isolating themselves from the outside world. Some of the students might also scare to go to the university for attending lectures, study, access libraries, etc., because they are unaware and confused, whether anyone in the class is affected by COVID and what if they get infected by others. To overcome this hesitation by students, a safe and secure environment/workplace is needed for individuals to perform their day-to-day activities. This, in turn, helps in freeing them out from their mental stress. Also, many people, because of this pandemic staying at home without getting exposed to the world, not attending parties, going to movies, and so on. Their mental health is disturbed because of isolating themselves from people (friends, relatives, colleagues, and so on).

Nowadays, COVID-19 vaccine is in place and were being given to many people based on priority and age i.e., first to healthcare workers, adults, and then to individuals above 16. There was a rumor that a nurse who works in Tennessee died after taking the vaccine. But the fact is she fainted, but not dead. However, to what extent the vaccine works, how effective it is, how many dosages it needs, what is the vaccine cycle needs to be known by everyone before taking the vaccine. But, on top of everything, how much time the vaccine will take to develop the antibodies is not known till now by all individuals.

Considering all these, I am developing an application, "Back to Teams", that helps individuals creating their workplace or join any workplace where their friends/colleagues are working/studying after taking the mandatory health assessment. This health assessment consists of various questions that need to be answered by individuals that will analyze how an individual should proceed further, either allowing them to create or join any workplace if there are no symptoms/not feeling sick or ask them to stay at home if there are symptoms or feeling sick. If they need supplies (masks, wipes, sanitizers, etc.,) or out of supplies, they can request that within the application itself.

**3. Problem Statement:**

The world used to be calm and peaceful without any complications in the life of human beings till November 2019. There was a breakout of the Coronavirus in December 2019, which made the world upside down. As everything has gone virtual because of this pandemic, people are experiencing isolation, and hesitating to step out confidently to go to their workplace and work with their team in case of any emergency as they are unaware whether the workplace is free from this virus, and this is stressing them mentally. However, vaccines are in use right now to ensure and make people free from this pandemic. Unfortunately, the world is still the same since 2019 after the invention of the vaccine as well, as people are more in number, and the results of the vaccine may or may not be accurate depending on the body of an individual.

Research studies state that around 176 countries were infected, and it is the most significant threat to humanity since the second world war. According to the WHO (World Health Organization), US hits the first place with a greater number of COVID-19 cases and the death rate. With the number of cases increasing enormously, people are worried and losing confidence to step out and go back to their workplace to work as a team. However, staying at home is developing a feeling of isolation for individuals causing mental stress. The current situation has made existing symptoms of depression and anxiety for some individuals worse and caused new symptoms for others. As early as March, nearly half of American adults said the pandemic had negatively affected their mental health. In one survey, 63% of respondents reported feelings of depression, anxiety, or both. And during the first week, COVID-19 has officially declared a pandemic, new prescriptions for anti-anxiety medications increased by nearly 40%. Public health actions, such as social distancing, making everything virtual, made people feel isolated/lonely, and increased stress and anxiety. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, loneliness and social isolation were prevalent across Europe, the USA, and China (10–40%). The situation has only worsened with the restrictions imposed to contain the viral spread (Hwang, et al., 2020). According to a survey, 60% of college students say the pandemic has made it harder to access mental health care, even as financial stresses and the prevalence of depression increased among them. According to a JAMA Network (Links to an external site.), the number of adults experiencing depression has tripled in the United States since the coronavirus outbreak began, with one in four adults reporting symptoms of depression. Recent surveys by telecommuting platform Flex Jobs (Links to an external site.) also reveal rising levels of mental health concerns among workers. Before the pandemic, 5% of employed workers and 7% of unemployed workers said their mental health was poor or very poor. Now, 18% of employed and 27% of unemployed workers say they struggle with mental health issues. 

A survey was conducted by Blind, the firm that provides anonymous social networks for verified professionals shows the fear of the workplace is steadily going up. It asked many employees across many companies, “Are you hesitant to go to work because of the coronavirus outbreak? The firm received responses from nearly 6,000 employees across 1,000 companies, out of which 70.1% reported that they are hesitant to go to the workplace because of this pandemic. From 1st March to 4th March, the concern among employees grew from 67.8% to 76.1%.

So, this project proposes to build a solution to ensure a safe workplace for people to go back to working confidently as a team and prevent them from being isolated. This application helps to boost their confidence levels while stepping out to their workplace and improving their mental health by providing them with team collaboration i.e., working with the peers, or co-employees removing the thought of being isolated.

**4. Research Questions:**

• Will the proposed solution help the individuals to overcome isolation and regain mental health because of the pandemic?

• Will the proposed solution ensure a safe and secure environment for individuals to continue their day-to-day responsibilities? 

**5. Literature Review:**

**Chen, Sun, and Feng (2020)** researched how COVID-19 isolation policies affected young people’s mental health. They claimed that COVID-19's emergence has had a significant impact on people's physical and mental health. To support this, they investigated the mental health of young people who have been isolated because of policy responses to Coronavirus disease. During the time of self-isolation, 992 college students completed an online survey to assess seven aspects of psychological well-being, including mental health, stress management experience, behavioral patterns, risk perception, academic stress, family relationships, and peer relationships. The researchers propose a six-step intervention approach for addressing young people's psychological issues when they are isolated. It offers practical advice on how to intervene psychologically in the face of a global threat.

**Stadtlander and Sickel (2020)** published a paper that examined how COVID-19 self-isolation affected both online and land-based faculty’s (working online due to COVID) workspace and work process. A total of 20 online and 6 land-based faculty completed email interviews and responded to Likert-type questions. Results indicated that online faculty were more satisfied with their home workplace but that both groups felt more negative about their online work, as they felt a loss of freedom and independence due to the isolation. As an increasing number of individuals work from home, understanding the experience is essential.

**Hamza, Ewing, Heath, Goldstein (2020)** compared the mental health of the students with preexisting mental concerns and the students who do not have any concerns psychologically. A survey was conducted in May 2019 for students suffering from mental illness to understand their mental health. These figures comparatively decreased for these students when surveyed in May 2020 and their mental health seems to be increased. But, On the contrary, these figures increased in the case of students not suffering from mental issues because of isolation adhering to COVID-19.

**Saltzman, Hansel, Bordnick (2020)** focused on exploring the potential impact of COVID-19 on loneliness and well-being. As physical distancing, quarantine, isolation is in place adhering to COVID-19 guidelines, how these restrictions affect a larger population in terms of mental health is analyzed.

**COVID-19 self-assessment** – Google, provides a set of questionnaires to assess our health condition based on the answers provided to those questions by individuals. It helps individuals decide what type of medical care they might need for COVID-19.

**6. Design**

The application, back to teams is for individuals using which they can create a safe and secure environment at their office/university to carry out their day-to-day responsibilities without undergoing any pressure of being attacked by the virus. This helps the individuals in rejuvenating their mental health as they can work with their colleagues/peers without any hesitation overcoming a feeling of being isolated.

There are four modules in this application.

**Sign Up for a POD:**

This is an option where individuals without creating a new POD can join in any available POD to work/study that was created by others. But this will be allowed only after taking a mandatory health assessment. The result of the assessment can be either they can proceed to work within that POD i.e., they can come to their workplace to carry out their activities or contact their health provider or stay at home and monitor for symptoms based on the answers they provided in the self-assessment.

**Create a POD:**

This includes individuals creating their own POD and inviting their peers/colleagues to that POD with whom they want to work or study. Before creating their own POD or inviting the members to that POD, a mandatory health screening needs to be taken by the individual. The result of the assessment can be either, they can create a POD i.e., they can come to their workplace to carry out their activities or contact their health provider based on the answers they have provided in the self-assessment. The members being invited have the right to either accept the request or reject it. If the request is accepted, health screening needs to be taken by them as well based on which they can proceed accordingly.

**Health Check:**

This is a self-assessment where individuals answer various questions concerned with their health. This screening allows individuals to assess their health themselves and let them know whether they are cleared to come to their workplace or not.

**Request Supplies:**

Once an individual creates a POD or sign up for a POD after taking the mandatory health assessment, they can ask for supplies like sanitizers, wipes, masks, hand soap, etc., This can be done by clicking the request supplies button that will trigger an email to the management.

If this application is used by individuals properly, the outcome will be very efficient and effective, which gives them proper guidance to lead their life as it was before COVID.

**9. Future Scope:**

•	**Exposer score** - Track the movement of people using the app and assign risk numbers to the places they travel to. The riskier places they travel to, the higher their exposure score will be.

•	Enable HRs/School Management to send notifications to people in a particular county/location about purple/red zones. 

•	Integrate app with Virtual Assistants from Health Department to assist them with precautions, next steps, counseling.

•	Allowing Companies/Universities to track the number of cases within the respective buildings.

•	Add more ways to ensure less spread by integrating special features for analyzing the temperature, anxiety levels, and so on.

•	The application can check (using a survey) if a person is suffering from constant anxiety, the organizations can assign counsellors/counselling sessions for such people.
