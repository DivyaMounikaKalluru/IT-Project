**1. Abstract:**

I think twice and hesitate to go to the university or any workplace to access the library, attend lectures, or work with my peers or colleagues as a team because of this pandemic as I am unaware whether the workplace is safe and secure free from COVID, and raises a question what if my peers or colleagues are suffering from this unknowingly. This always creates a kind of disturbance in me, resulting in mental stress. Along with this, with everything gone online, I get a feeling of isolation that is causing issues with my mental health. Many people might be facing similar issues. So, considering all these, I want to address the problem of isolation and make the situation like before it used to be by providing them with a COVID free environment so that they can get exposed to their workplace and work with their peers or colleagues of their choice without any second thought, which helps in preventing a feeling of isolation, raising their confidence levels improving their mental health. In this IT project, I want to focus on developing an application that will provide people with a secure environment to work as a team of their choice confidently without thinking about the current pandemic and make them relieved from their mental stress by not worrying about being isolated from everyone or the work environment. 

**2. Introduction:**

Coronavirus, which is prevalent in the world right now, started at the end of 2019 in China. It spread rapidly across 150 nations, with the United States recording a greater number of cases, making everyone work remotely from their home by not contacting anyone personally (face to face). Many of the universities as well, followed the same protocol and shut down universities completely after 2020 spring break. Although there was a complete lockdown starting from March 2020 to August 2020, 18,738,58 laboratory-confirmed cases got recorded as of the 2nd week of April 2020. Working remotely and the shutdown of the universities suddenly developed a feeling of being isolated in individuals affecting their mental health. According to a journal by Cambridge University Press Public Health Emergency Collection, loneliness has several adverse impacts on mental health like reduced sleep efficiency increased depressive Symptomatology, and suicidal symptoms. Some of the universities are conducting at least one in-person lecturing to students starting from August 2020. But the IT companies are still following the same and encouraging the employees to work remotely. This is like isolating themselves from the outside world. Some of the students might also scare to go to the university for attending lectures, study, access libraries, etc. because they are unaware and in confusion, whether anyone in the class is affected by COVID and what if they get infected by others. To overcome this hesitation by students, a safe and secure environment/workplace is needed for individuals to perform their day-to-day activities. This, in turn, helps in freeing them out from their mental stress. Also, many people because of this pandemic staying at home without getting exposed to the world, not attending parties, going to movies, and so on. Their mental health is disturbed because of isolating themselves from people (friends, relatives, colleagues, and so on). Considering all these, I am developing an application that helps individuals creating their workplace or join in any workplace where their friends/colleagues are working/studying after taking the mandatory health assessment. This health assessment consists of various questions that need to be answered by individuals that allow them to create or join any workplace if the result is negative. If they need supplies or out of supplies, they can request that within the application itself. 

**3. Problem Statement:**

The world used to be calm and peaceful without any complications in the life of human beings till November 2019. There was a breakout of the Coronavirus in December 2019, which made the world upside down. As everything has gone virtual because of this pandemic, people are experiencing isolation and hesitating to step out confidently to go to their workplace and work with their team in case of any emergency as they are unaware whether the workplace is free from this virus, and this is stressing them mentally. However, vaccines are in use right now to ensure and make people free from this pandemic. Unfortunately, the world is still the same since 2019 after invention of the vaccine as well, as people are more in number, and the results of the vaccine may or may not be accurate depending on the body of an individual. Research studies state that around 176 countries were infected, and it is the most significant threat to humanity since the second world war. According to the WHO (World Health Organization), US hits the first place with a greater number of COVID-19 cases and the death rate. With the number of cases increasing enormously, people are worried and losing confidence to step out and go back to their workplace to work as a team. However, staying at home is developing a feeling of isolation for individuals causing mental stress. The current situation has made existing symptoms of depression and anxiety for some people worse and caused new symptoms for others. As early as March, nearly half of American adults said the pandemic had negatively affected their mental health. In one survey, 63% of respondents reported feelings of depression, anxiety, or both. And during the first week, COVID-19 has officially declared a pandemic, new prescriptions for anti-anxiety medications increased by nearly 40%. Public health actions, such as social distancing, making everything virtual, made people feel isolated/lonely and increased stress and anxiety. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, loneliness and social isolation were prevalent across Europe, the USA, and China (10–40%). The situation has only worsened with the restrictions imposed to contain the viral spread. According to a survey, 60% of college students say the pandemic has made it harder to access mental health care, even as financial stresses and the prevalence of depression increased among them. According to a JAMA Network (Links to an external site.), the number of adults experiencing depression has tripled in the United States since the coronavirus (Links to an external site.) outbreak began, with one in four adults reporting symptoms of depression. Recent surveys by telecommuting platform Flex Jobs (Links to an external site.) also reveal rising levels of mental health concerns among workers. Before the pandemic, 5% of employed workers and 7% of unemployed workers said their mental health was poor or very poor. Now, 18% of employed and 27% of unemployed workers say they struggle with mental health issues. So, this project proposes to build a solution to ensure a safe workplace for people to go back to working confidently as a team and prevent them from being isolated. This helps in boosting their confidence levels while stepping out to their workplace and improving their mental health by providing them with team collaboration i.e., working with the peers or co-employees removing the thought of being isolated.

**4. Research Questions:**

• Will the proposed solution help the individuals to overcome isolation and regain mental health because of the pandemic?

• Will the proposed solution ensure a safe and secure environment for individuals to continue their day-to-day responsibilities? 

**5. Literature Review:**

1. Chen, B., Sun, J., & Feng, Y. (2020). How have COVID-19 isolation policies affected young people’s mental health? –evidence from Chinese college students. Frontiers in psychology, 11. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7327104/ The breakout of COVID-19 has brought about a huge influence on people’s physical and mental health. This paper aims to investigate the mental health status of young people living in isolation due to the policy response to Coronavirus disease. An online survey was conducted in the period of self-isolation with 992 college students to measure seven dimensions of psychological well-being, including mental status, knowledge of stress management, behavioral patterns, risk perception, academic stress, family relationships, and peer relationships. This paper also proposes a six-step intervention strategy to alleviate young people’s psychological problems while in isolation. It provides practical insights into the psychological interventions in face of the global threat. 2. Stadtlander, L., & Sickel, A. (2020, October 1-2). Home as workplace for faculty during COVID-19 self-isolation [Paper presentation]. Walden University Research Conference 2020 (online). https://scholarworks.waldenu.edu/researchconference/2020/papers/1/ This paper examined how COVID-19 self-isolation affected both online and land-based faculty’s (working online due to COVID) workspace and work process. A total of 20 online and 6 land-based faculty completed email interviews and responded to Likert-type questions. Results indicated that online faculty were more satisfied with their home workplace but that both groups felt more negative about their online work, as they felt a loss of freedom and independence due to the isolation. As an increasing number of individuals work from home, understanding the experience is essential. 3. Lucchetti, G., Góes, L. G., Amaral, S. G., Ganadjian, G. T., Andrade, I., de Araújo Almeida, P. O., ... & Manso, M. E. G. (2020). Spirituality, religiosity and the mental health consequences of social isolation during Covid-19 pandemic. The International journal of social psychiatry. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7649649/ This article investigated the association between Religiosity/Spirituality and the mental health consequences of social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. The COVID-19 pandemic is having and will have important consequences, not only to the physical health but also to the mental health of the population. A recent systematic review has identified that these psychiatric consequences can have implications for both the short and long terms and will probably increase the prevalence of depression, anxiety, fatigue, insomnia, and post-traumatic stress. Exposure to pandemic stress and social isolation seems to increase mental health problems. The findings indicated that there was a high use of religious and spiritual beliefs during the pandemic and that this use was associated with better health outcomes, as evidenced by the higher levels of hopefulness and lower levels of fear, worrying, and sadness in the more religious and spiritual participants. 4. https://landing.google.com/screener/covid19 Google COVID-19 self-assessment. It provides a set of questions to assess our health condition based on the answers provided to those questions by individuals. This helps individuals decide what type of medical care they might need for COVID-19. 5. Der Feltz-Cornelis, V., Maria, C., Varley, D., Allgar, V. L., & De Beurs, E. (2020).

Frontiers in psychiatry, 11, 1284. https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.588803/full This article focused on studying the impact of COVID-19 on workers and students at the university of York, UK. In this study, the researchers analyzed how the remote working and furlough affects individuals at the university. To analyze this, researchers conducted a survey to measure stress levels. 7% of staff and 10% of students reported sickness absence. 26% of staff and 40% of the students experienced presenteeism. 22–24% of staff reported clinical-level anxiety and depression scores, and 37.2 and 46.5% of students. Staff experienced high stress levels due to COVID-19 (66.2%, labeled vulnerable) and 33.8% experienced low stress levels (labeled resilient). Students were 71.7% resilient vs. 28.3% non-resilient. 6.

When social isolation is nothing new: A longitudinal study psychological distress during COVID-19 among university students with and without preexisting mental health concerns. Canadian Psychology/Psychologie canadienne. https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-66840-001 This study compares the mental health of the students with preexisting mental concerns and the students who do not have any concerns psychologically. A survey was conducted in May 2019 for students suffering from mental illness to understand their mental health. These figures comparatively decreased for these students when surveyed in May 2020 and their mental health seems to be increased. But, On the contrary, these figures increased in the case of students not suffering from mental issues because of isolation adhering to COVID-19. 7. Saltzman, L. Y., Hansel, T. C., & Bordnick, P. S.

Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice, and Policy. https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2020-43457-001.pdf This paper focuses on exploring the potential impact of COVID-19 on loneliness and well-being. As physical distancing, quarantine, isolation is in place adhering to COVID-19 guidelines, how these restrictions affect a larger population in terms of mental health is analyzed.

**6. Design**

The application, back to teams is for individuals using which they can create a safe and secure environment at their office/university to carry out their day-to-day responsibilities without undergoing any pressure of being attacked by the virus. This helps the individuals in rejuvenating their mental health as they can work with their colleagues/peers without any hesitation overcoming a feeling of being isolated. There are four modules in this application.

**Sign Up for a POD:**

This is an option where individuals without creating a new POD can join in any available POD to work/study that was created by others. But this will be allowed only after taking a mandatory health assessment. The result of the assessment can be either they can proceed to work within that POD i.e., they can come to their workplace to carry out their activities or contact their health provider based on the answers they have provided in the self-assessment.

**Create a POD:**

This includes individuals creating their own POD and inviting their peers/colleagues to that POD with whom they want to work or study. Before creating their own POD or inviting the members to that POD, a mandatory health screening needs to be taken by the individual. The result of the assessment can be either, they can create a POD i.e., they can come to their workplace to carry out their activities or contact their health provider based on the answers they have provided in the self-assessment. The members being invited have the right to either accept the request or reject it. If the request is accepted, health screening needs to be taken by them as well based on which they can proceed accordingly.

**Health Check:**

This is a self-assessment where individuals answer various questions concerned with their health. This screening allows individuals to assess their health themselves and let them know whether they are cleared to come to their workplace or not.

**Request Supplies:**

Once an individual creates a POD or sign up for a POD after taking the mandatory health assessment, they can ask for supplies like sanitizers, wipes, masks, hand soap, etc., This can be done by clicking the request supplies button that will trigger an email to the management.

**8. Conclusion:**

In conclusion, this application provides a healthy workplace for individuals to carry out their responsibilities after taking a mandatory health screening adhering to COVID-19 guidelines, ensures face to face team collaboration without any hesitation, improve mental health as a feeling of isolation and mental stress will be removed by working in a COVID free environment with their colleagues/peers of their choice which helps to increase productivity by enabling employees to focus on their work and students to concentrate on their academics not worrying about contracting COVID-19. If this application is used by individuals properly, the outcome will be very efficient and effective, which gives them proper guidance to lead their life as it was before COVID.

**9. Future Scope:**

• Exposer score - Track the movement of people using the app and assign risk numbers to the places they travel to. The riskier places they travel to, the higher their exposure score will be.

• Enable HRs to send notifications to people in a particular county/location about purple/red zones.

• Integrate app with Virtual Assistants from Health Department to assist them with precautions, next steps, counseling.

• Allowing Companies/Universities to track the number of cases within the respective buildings.

• Add more ways to ensure less spread by integrating special features for analyzing the temperature, anxiety levels, and so on.

• The application can check (using a survey) if a person is suffering from constant anxiety, the organizations can assign counselors/counseling sessions for such people.
